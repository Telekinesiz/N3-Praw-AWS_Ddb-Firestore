The drug does not appear to work at improving patient functioning, and it was [approved by the FDA under questionable circumstances](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/26/politics/alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-fda-approval/index.html).\n\nHonestly, this looks more like another move to transfer wealth from the American people to company executives and stockholders than to improve the lives of people with a terminal disease.

It was always more likely he was LARPing for psycho conservative (Qult) support - which he obviously got.

They don’t want to imagine dad went ignorantly homicidal. \n\nSigh. I won’t be the least bit shocked when we have to learn about dad actually trafficking girls.

The lawyer had to go along with the plan or the father to go along with the lawyer's plan, plus a rubber stamping judge, to bilk her of her money. To me, that is what looks like happened, and it wouldn't be the first time some rich woman was effectively institutionalized so unscrupulous people could steal her money. All it takes is a corrupt judge and a lawyer to make it work. My guess here is she wants to expose them all for what they are, and recovery of the money is secondary. Her lawyer (and Brit) is out for blood and he will get it, in her behalf, for the horror they put her through. And I will guess that she will go as far as to sue, then seize assets of all participants. Her knives are coming out and revenge is her driving force.",

Child care is more expensive and because people don’t want low paying jobs daycare centers can’t find workers and have had to cut back on the amount of children they can care for. Some parents probably had to quit to stay home with their kids or found it wasn’t worth it when most of their pay went to day care. The fact that so many people quit when you would expect children to go back to school proves there is a much larger issue with employers.",

Thankfully it did not. I had no plan though, I just couldn’t do it anymore. I have type 1 diabetes and rely on medical insurance to live and it was a huge risk but thankfully I had supportive family and friends and a good amount of savings (was trying to buy a house but that’s on hold). \n\nWithin a week I had already received two offers that paid considerably more, just from random recruiters from big companies on LinkedIn. I found a job that now pays me double what I made previously and the culture is phenomenal. It took 2 months (lots of interviews, decision making and start date was pushed out a bit) but it was 1000% worth it.\n\nMy point is that it’s a 100% a great market right now. Companies are desperate in some cases for talent. The companies who treat their employees like shit are getting exposed and exposed badly! Try to have a plan if you can, but go out there and find something that MAKES YOU HAPPY and pays you well!! I’m only 30, I’m not going to fuckin slave away for the rest of my life. If I can do it then anyone can. Good luck and remember that as an employee, you are in control! You have all the leverage.",

Childcare is another huge one. The cost of childcare per month is quite literally one spouses entire paycheck, so they just said fuck it and dropped out of the workforce to spend time with their children. A win-win. Many people retired early. They took their nest egg out of the home equity and blew up home prices all over the country buying their retirement homes, and giving their children cash down payments to buy their own overpriced properties. This won't last forever. And when it levels out, you're going to have an even wider gulf between people who have and have not. \n\nImagine saving for a home down payment for decades on a lower end salary and finally having nearly $40 or $50k.

I manage one program directly and handle a number of special research projects for the Secretary of my Agency (not going to say which state but it's currently a republican administration).\n\nFor this fairly serious managerial role with pretty high stakes and a lot of money involved, I'm currently an hourly employee making about $55,000 a year. I get zero paid holidays, zero 401k or 401k matching or retirement benefits of any kind, 8 days of PTO a year (inclusive of vacation and sick days), and I pay about $225 a month for my healthcare premium. I am given no additional benefits of any kind.\n\nIn May of 2021 I strongly requested a raise as the work I was doing had dramatically increased both in scope, size and importance since they initially hired me and I believed I was being substantially underpaid. I asked for a raise to $60,000 (which would still be far too low, but I doubted they'd go higher). They rejected my request and offered a 50 cent an hour raise instead, saying it would cover \"cost of living increases.\" They then told me that I'm correct that both the amount of my work and the importance of my work has increased substantially since they hired me, but that there just wasn't money in the state budget to give me the raise I wanted (this isn't true) but that we could revisit it in a few months when my then contract was over.\n\nFast forward to the end of August 2021, my contract is up, and I ask for the raise we talked about in May before re-signing. They rejected my request, again, this time saying it wouldn't be \"fair\" to the other program managers who only manage one program and who make about the same that I do, ignoring all of the special projects that they'd assigned me at this point. Keep in mind, I'm asking for a raise from 55k to 60k that's long overdue, and in the private sector I'd likely be making 90k+ for this work, and that my benefits are essentially non-existent. I don't even get paid for Christmas Day.\n\nAnyways, they refused to give me anything, so I've been stuck at 55k with almost no benefits, and I'm working on finding a new job so I can leave these fucking assholes as soon as possible.",

Further conditions aside, if you aren’t afraid I guess we can’t make you get one, you aren’t doing anyone or yourself a favor, the religious exemption eh whatever. To claim that it’s less dangerous to go without a vaccine well , there are many many dead who would tell you otherwise. This isn’t about government distrust or hesitance. It was made political and an underdog us vs them, it is a virus it has no party affiliation or allegiance, it has one goal to infect, spread and infect, if it kills or maims you otherwise is irrelevant. Protect yourself and your loved ones, get vaccinated, wash your hands, avoid spreading an illness to others. Don’t feed them misinformation. Mandates maybe the only way to help get this crap even sort of under control and if we had started earlier rather than it having been made political we may actually have made some damn progress.",

Everyone trying to correct it best they can. These poor folks at Astroworld were fucked with that many in attendance but I dont know how it is avoidable. Many times when a pit opens up and that circle widens, people watching a show are suddenly shoved in a direction into others and it can get dangerous.\n\nMy point is that Live Nation is now requiring covid vaccine proof before entering and I wouldn't be surprised if they roll out a long ass, you wont read, terms of service type thing u must agree to so they avoid liability for any future shows they put on.",

                "Comment": "Speaking as a former CPS worker, in missing persons cases concerning either children or adults, this is a reason it's generally best to contact law enforcement directly when you think you have information. Not the parents, or whoever made a social media post, etc. You never know *why* the person is missing, and if they're trying to escape an abuser you may end up inadvertently putting them back in harm's way by contacting whichever family member or partner is putting up posters/sharing posts on social media/etc. \n\nI'd also note that arrests in these cases aren't usually common unless there is specific evidence to believe the mother did it. \"He said/she said\" is very common with potential runaway teen situations, and it can be difficult to parse out \"ran away from home with their 25 year old \"boyfriend\" because mom and dad try to keep him away from her (ie, abducted by pedophile)\" and \"ran away using whatever help they could get because mom/dad are abusive.\" Generally wouldn't expect law enforcement or court action to occur without something stronger than just the word of the teenager. In this case, the mother appearing to lie about the child being abducted could meet that criteria, especially if the child has observable injuries, though even that can get muddled because injuries are fairly common in runaway teens as well due to the rough nature of living on the street (often with other abuse happening to them as a result). Whatever the evidence, it's bad enough that the 3 year old sibling was removed from the mother's custody as well, so I'd err on it being substantive (as much as that's possible with minimal info from the news articles).\n\n\n\nTLDR: I just hope the kid will get the help she needs, and am curious to see how what happens with the criminal charges.",

I'm not a Musk fan by any means (I've made plenty of comments in the past about how electric car tech is nowhere near ready for full adoption), but there is some next level stuff here.\n\nStarlink satts orbit at a lower altitude than the ISS and won't really contribute to Kessler Syndrome, due to how fast their orbits degrade. Just because the ISS had to swerve last week doesn't mean that Starlink is a bad thing. Just because higher layers of LEO are pretty saturated doesn't mean that Starlink will contribute to that issue, nor have any effect on it.",
